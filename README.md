# Slaying the `if-hydra`

This repo is the source material for the book "Slaying the If-Hydra" by Greg Smith.

In each chapter, a problem is presented. Then "The Hydra" solution is laid out, demonstrating the often naive solution using `if/then/else if/else` solutions. Then "The Sword" solution is presented which "slays" the `if-hydra`.

Examples withing the `README.md` files are in `Python` code. However there are folders for each of Python and JavaScript with complete solutions.

Also, each solution is provided with a full unit test as an introduction to unit testing.
